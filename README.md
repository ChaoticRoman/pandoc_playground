# Pandoc playground

[Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) is a markup formats converter, often called markup documents swiss knife.

Here I am interested in three usecases using Markdown (md) as a source format:

1. **Markdown to slides**
    I like markdown, let's see if I can use it for presentation preparations.
2. **Markdown to PDF**:
    The md format is great for source control, let's try to have user guides and other printable documents
    like that maintained in md.
3. **Markdown to HTML**:
    Online documentation and in-application documents and any rich text format in custom apps (HTML renderers
    are often parts of various frameworks unless the MD rendering).
4. **Single documentation source**:
    Bonus point as having the same source for numbers 2 and 3.
